;;; Commentary:

;; This library defines a face named `parenthesis' used just for
;; parentheses.  The intended purpose of this face is to make
;; parentheses less visible in Lisp code by dimming them.

;; We lispers probably don't need to be constantly made aware of the
;; existence of the parentheses.  Dimming them might be even more
;; useful for people new to lisp who have not yet learned to
;; subconsciously blend out the parentheses.

;; To use the `parenthesis' face, turn on `global-paren-face-mode'.
;; The option `paren-face-modes' controls in what buffers the minor
;; mode `paren-face-mode' is turned on.

;; The parenthesis at or before point, as well as the parenthesis at
;; the other end of the s-expression should actually stand out, but
;; that is beyond the scope of the mode defined here.  Instead use one
;; of the modes dedicated to that, e.g. the builtin `show-paren-mode'.

;; While this face is intended to be used with Lisp modes, it also
;; works with other major modes, just add the mode to value of
;; `paren-face-modes'.

;; By default only parentheses are dimmed, customize option
;; `paren-face-regexp' if you also want to dim brackets or braces.
;; If you want to use a differnt regexp in different major-modes,
;; then use a the mode hook to set the buffer local value.

;;; History:

;; Dave Pearson's `parenface.el' implements the same basic idea.
;; Unfortunately that library doesn't use the appropriate Emacs
;; interfaces correctly, so I wrote this as a replacement.
